1) change in Est struct: initial estimates of distances are 0.521 between every different cities
2) Params struct: we specify initial and final values of beta and number of betas  we want to use. 
                  Then we will use linspace method to get other values of beta.
3) sample cost function: only changed names of variables we return, e--> est, s--> obs
4) function macau: added one for loop for beta in list of betas that are linearly spaced.
